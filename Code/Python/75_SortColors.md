# LeetCode Problem #75 — Search a 2D Matrix      

## Problem Description
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Solution (Python)

```python

class Solution(object):
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(0, len(nums) - i - 1):
                if nums[j] > nums[j + 1]:
                    nums[j], nums[j + 1] = nums[j + 1], nums[j]

        return nums


```
## Examples

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
