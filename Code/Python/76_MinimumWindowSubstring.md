# LeetCode Problem #76 — Minimum Window Substring

## Problem Description
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

## Solution (Python)

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not s or not t:
            return ""

        need = Counter(t)
        missing = len(t)

        left = 0
        start = 0
        min_len = float("inf")

        for right in range(len(s)):
            if need[s[right]] > 0:
                missing -= 1
            need[s[right]] -= 1

            while missing == 0:
                if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                    min_len = right - left + 1
                    start = left

                need[s[left]] += 1
                if need[s[left]] > 0:
                    missing += 1
                left += 1

        return "" if min_len == float("inf") else s[start:start + min_len]

```

## Examples

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window. Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
